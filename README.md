## üß≠ Overview
This week emphasized mastering Java's commonly used data structures such as `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, and `HashMap`, while also introducing best practices for managing errors through exception handling. These are foundational concepts that prepare you to write robust, efficient, and maintainable Java code.

## üìå Topics Covered

### Day 1: Introduction to Collections and List Interface
- What is the Java Collections Framework?
- Introduction to `ArrayList`
- Adding, removing, and accessing elements
- Differences between arrays and lists

### Day 2: Set and Map Interfaces
- Understanding `HashSet` and its uniqueness constraint
- Adding and checking elements in a set
- Introduction to `HashMap`
- Storing and retrieving key-value pairs

### Day 3: Iterators and Enhanced For Loop
- Using enhanced `for` loop with collections
- Using `Iterator` and `ListIterator`
- Avoiding `ConcurrentModificationException`
- Modifying collections safely during iteration

### Day 4: Exception Handling (try-catch-finally)
- What are exceptions?
- Types of exceptions: checked vs unchecked
- Using `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks
- Multiple catch blocks
- `throw` and `throws` keywords

### Day 5: Custom Exceptions
- Creating user-defined exception classes
- Throwing custom exceptions
- Use cases for custom exceptions

### Day 6: Practice Problems with Collections and Exceptions
- Solving real-world problems using lists, sets, and maps
- Applying exception handling in programs
- Combining data structures and custom error handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- Familiarity with OOP principles in Java (Week 2)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Code editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

## üìÇ How to Use This Repository
Each day of the week is organized into a dedicated folder containing example programs, notes, and practice exercises. You are encouraged to read the code, run it in your IDE, and modify it to reinforce your understanding.
